# Pylette
<img src="Example/pylette.png" width=100 align="right">
Have you ever had to painstakingly add colors to your palette by hand because the source image has too many colors to be imported in your Editor? The Pylette has come to save your time!

## Usage
Let's take this bold picture as an example.

<img src="Example/Bold_and_Brash.png" width=200>

We can open this masterpiece in the Pylette.

<img src="Example/open_file.png" width=700>

After the picture is opened, the colors are shown in the Pylette where you can edit, add or delete colors. Afterwards, you can export your palette.

<img src="Example/export.png" width=700>

The resulting palette looks like this:

<img src="Example/bold_palette.png" width=250>

Now you can import the palette in your image processing program.

<img src="Example/import_aseprite.png" width=700>

## Why use Pylette over built-in palette functionality?
Many image editing programs allow you to import palettes from images but since they don't focus on it they have a few weaknesses. A badly scaled pixel art image has way more colors than meets the eye. The original pixel art has only these 7 colors:

<img src="Example/bold_all.png" width=250>

But when importing a badly resized picture gets imported into pixel editor, this happens:

<img src="Example/bold_n_aseprite.png" width=700>

This many colors are suboptimal and you would have to remove most of them and this just takes time. You can simply open the image in Pylette and directly get a good palette.

<img src="Example/bold_bad_palette.png" width=250>

But this isn't exactly the original palette and you want to edit it. First thing you could try is editing the import settings and resetting the file.

<img src="Example/settings_window.png" height=400>

You can also delete, add or edit existing colors.

<img src="Example/colordialog.png" width=500>

Here you also have the ability to pick a screen color which can make adding a very specific color way easier.

## Installation

### Windows
Just double-click the pylette.exe.

### Linux
Find the Pylette file and double-click it.  
If this doesn't work you have to give the pylette file executable permission.  
You can do this with `chmod +x /path/to/pylette`.
I would also recommend you to create a .desktop file so you can open it with an application icon and the ability to start it outside the directory of the executable.
### MacOs
I don't have a Mac; if there is enough demand I may look into options to make an executable.

## Quirks
No program is perfect and the Pylette is a program so it would be better when you know about it quirks.

* Resetting a file not only resets the whole palette and the changed colors in the palette but does so according to the current settings as if you were deleting and adding the file.
* When you add a file, only the current settings are important. So if you want to add multiple pictures with different settings you can do that.
* When you import a picture with alpha channel... your palette won't have said alpha channel.
* When you import a gif only the first frame counts.
* If you have problems with a weird settings window; try to resize it.
* You can change a color in the palette by clicking on the color which opens a colordialog.
* Right-click on a color to delete it.
* If you want to add a color from your screen you must open a colordialog and there you will find an option to pick a color from your screen.
* That the "Custom Color" in the combobox never goes away is neither a bug nor a feature... it's less work.
* The Pylette can only work with rgb and rgb-compatible colorspaces.
* If your palette has a lot of colors and you can open the exported palette then try setting the scaling setting to 1 because otherwise you picture may be to big to open.

## For Developers

### Requirements
* Used Python 3.7.2 but should be perfectly compatible down to 3.6. If you want to go lower, you need to replace f-strings with another syntax formatting.  
* Built with PyQt5 5.12.1; PyQt5 5.13.0 and Pyinstaller don't work well with each other.  
* Pillow 6.1.0 but newer version should work.  
* Pyinstaller 3.5 but newer versions should work.  

### Building executables
To create an executable you need to have pyinstaller installed.
1. cd to the directory
2. Run the command `pyinstaller -w -i Example/pylette_256.ico main.py`.
3. Rename the main(.exe) to pylette(.exe) (optional).
4. Copy the config.json and pylette_256.png into the folder with the executable.
